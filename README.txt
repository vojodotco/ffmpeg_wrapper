Go to admin/settings/ffmpeg_wrapper

Make sure you configure the path to FFmpeg. This is relative to the root 
of your server. If don't know where FFmpeg is installed and you have
access to the command line of your server, you can run:

#locate ffmpeg

This should hopefully give you a path to ffmpeg. 
If you need install FFmpeg, there are instructions here for installing 
it on a debian/ubuntu environment:
